        <h2>An Intergalactic Adventure</h2>

        <p>
The year is 2995 and humanity is in a golden age of exploration with you at the forefront. However, marooned on a distant planet your worst fears come to surface. A deadly alien race pursues you across the difficult terrain of your homeworld and even invades your mangled space ship. Your wits and your blaster are the only tools you have and all you can do is buy time until you are rescued.
